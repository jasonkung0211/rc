## Scripts for Ubuntu/Debian

This is a compilation of my scripts in Ubuntu or Debian that I consider useful. Feel free to use and change the scripts as you like.

### 1. How to run the scripts

To run the scripts, open a terminal console and execute:

```
bash name_of_the_script.sh
```

### 2. Order of execution to set up Ubuntu or Debian

When I have just installed Ubuntu or Debian I execute a serie of scripts to set up my GNU/Linux OS. The order is the following:

1. Install additional command-line interface (CLI) software ([script](https://github.com/milq/scripts-ubuntu-debian/blob/master/scripts/debian/install-additional-cli-software.sh)).
2. Install additional graphical user interface (GUI) software ([script](https://github.com/milq/scripts-ubuntu-debian/blob/master/scripts/debian/install-additional-gui-software.sh)).
